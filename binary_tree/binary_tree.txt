A Binary Tree can have at most 2 children
It is a hierarchial type of data structure
for example : a computer has many drives inside which we have resp folders 
and so on . 
we have a root node , under which we have say siblings , and each sibling may have at most 
2 children and so on , a node with no child is called a leaf node.

we have levels in a Tree
height of a tree - max level , from node to the deepest leaf
depth of a tree -  from root to that node

creating , searching , traversal


 tree prblms follow a recursive structure

 important topic for interviews

 mostly , all prblms can be solved by dividing them into sub problems 
 and making recursive calls on subtrees or iteratively
