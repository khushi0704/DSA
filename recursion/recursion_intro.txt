to get answer for the bigger problem 

example : most classical : factorial

fact(n) : n*fact(n-1)

base case : (here the probleme cannot be broken further)
fact(0) = 1
fact(1) = 1

return a larger problem in return of a smaller problem

base case : ans of the sub problem

two directions :
 towards the base case (top down approach)
 towards the problem (bottom up approach)

 another example : 

 we can define the operation "go to home " as 
  base case :
  when you have reached home : stop moving 

  recursive case :
  2) take one step toward home
  3)"go to home"


 => recursion = principle of mathematical induction
  1)figure of the smallest case
  2) always assume the subproblem can
   be solved
  3) solve the current problem assuming 
  subproblem solution exists
