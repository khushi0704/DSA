topological sorting for directed acyclic graph(DAG) is a linear 
ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u,v ,
vertex u comes before v in ordering.Topological sorting for a graph is not 
possible if the graph is not a DAG

Appications :
scheduling jos from the given dependencies
among jobs.comp sci applications of this type arise
in :
2)instruction scheduling
3)ordering of formula cell evaluation when recomputing
formula values in spreadsheet
4)Logic synthesis
5)Determining the order of compilation tasks to perform
in make files,data serialization,and resolving symbols
dependencies in linkers
