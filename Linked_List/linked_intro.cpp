#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
/* container that stores data in some eequence structure

array/vector occupies continous memory 
on the other hand , the node that store the data , they allocate
on hand , memeory is created on the fly

say we create a node that store 1
now we want to store 2 , it is allocated dynamically

, the buckets dont lie in continous but in 
different part
but we need to store in sequence

we create a bucket called head which stores address 
of first node - 1
then 1 stores address of 2nd bucket
and so on
this chain is called linked list
we have a head called node star , which stores add of 1 st node . 

initialized dynamically



BASIC OPERATIONS :

Insertion : head , mid , tail
Searching : iteratively / recursievely
Deletion : head , mid , tail
Creating a linked list : 
deleeting a linekd list
printing a linked list

Approaches :
OOP - have a class list that stores head poiter and have member fun that will
do insrertion etc
Functions - head pointer in main , to ervy fun , pass that main

how list stl is written

implementation can be tricky , carefully handle null pointer and corner cases
improper handling can lead to segmentation fault
